Welcome to **Frosty Bounce**, the ultimate winter-themed paddle and ball game! In this chilly challenge, your goal is to keep the snowball bouncing as long as you can, using your ice paddle to prevent it from touching the frozen ground. Every time the snowball hits your paddle, you’ll earn points and increase your score. Control the paddle with smooth mouse movements, gliding it across the icy surface. But be careful – if the snowball slips past your paddle, the game restarts. Get ready for a fun-filled winter adventure and see how high you can score in this frosty quest!

In my Scratch project, I created a simple ball and paddle game. The ball bounces around the screen, and your goal is to prevent it from touching the bottom line by using the paddle. The paddle follows the X direction of your mouse. Every time the ball touches the paddle, your score increases. If the ball touches the bottom line, the game resets, and you can try again to achieve a higher score!
